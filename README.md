# Steam Minge
The Steam Minge is a trolling application that utilizes the Steamworks.NET framework to mass send messages, send invites, and other annoying things!

## Note
The new steam chat system has an anti-spam system built into it. That makes the chat spamming portion of the minge pretty useless.

## Usage
1. Download the project and open it in VS 2015/2017.
2. Select release mode and build the project. The executables will be dumped in the SteamMinge/bin/Release folder. 
3. Run and enjoy.


## TODO
Currently don't have any todos for this project. If there is something you'd like added, feel free to submit a request.
